# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository documents my journey of learning Python as a Computer Science undergraduate.

I started with Python fundamentals and gradually moved towards intermediate concepts and small projects.
The code in this repository reflects my learning at different stages and is continuously improved as I gain more understanding.
