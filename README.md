# Python Learning Journey 🐍

This repository documents my journey of learning Python as a Computer Science undergraduate.

I started with Python fundamentals and gradually moved towards intermediate concepts and small projects.
The code in this repository reflects my learning at different stages and is continuously improved as I gain more understanding.

## Repository Structure

- **basics/**  
  Python fundamentals such as variables, loops, conditions, and functions.

- **intermediate/**  
  Topics like basic Data Structures(List,Tuples,Dictionary etc.,)file handling, exception handling.

- **python-projects/**  
  Small practical projects built to apply Python concepts.
  
  - **tkinter-calculator/**  
    A simple GUI-based calculator built using Python's Tkinter library.
  
  - **password-checker/**  
    A file-handling based project that validates user credentials using stored data.

## Highlight Projects

- **Tkinter Calculator**  
  A simple calculator built to understand GUI programming and event handling in Python.

- **Password Checker**  
  A project created to practice file handling, loops, conditionals, and basic validation logic.

## Purpose

- Strengthen Python fundamentals  
- Practice writing clean and readable code  
- Apply concepts through small practical projects  
- Build a foundation for open-source contributions  

This repository is part of my continuous learning journey.
